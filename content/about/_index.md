I am an undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati. I will be graduating in May 2022 with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering.

I've been fascinated by the world of computers since the first time I used one. I'd decided to become a software developer as early as when I was twelve. Soon after that, I started my JEE preparation. With a lot of hard work and a pinch of luck, I found myself anchored at IIT Guwahati. I like writing APIs and working on the backend. I love training ML models. I have a knack for solving challenging problems, discussing new ideas and exploring new technologies like ethereum.

When I'm not doing any of the above, you can find me reading novels, playing Valorant or experimenting in the kitchen. I like meeting new people and making new friends. I look forward to hearing from you.
