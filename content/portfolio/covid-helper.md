#### Project Details

This was a project created by the Student Web Committee of IIT, Guwahati designed to help bridge the communication gap between the suppliers and the consumers during the COVID-19 lockdown in India. The project uses GeoDjango tools to find the requirements of nearby consumers (within a distance of five kilometers of users). The community can vote on the urgency of the requirements. The votes are essentially likes. The more votes a request has, the higher its urgency rating is. Finally there are the admins. The admins can view many requests in their area. The admins can also view the phone numbers of the users which are verified with a use of OTP verification.
