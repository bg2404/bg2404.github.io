#### Project Details

Many students do not know about all the candidates who are contesting for Students' Gymkhana Committee elections before choosing their favourite candidate. So, to solve this problem Students' Web Committee developed Pre Election Portal wherein all the candidates can present the information about them, including their agendas. Students can also discuss and question the candidates' policies and action plan on the portal itself.
